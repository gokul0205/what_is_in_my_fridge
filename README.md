# what is in my fridge?

A beta version of what's in fridge

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
This project mainly focuses on storing the items bought and then displaying them datewise so the ones expiring can be noticed without fail. This is just a simple app ,which is done out  of curiosity. Feel free to take this up and improve as per requirement. It would be great if you can link back here.
